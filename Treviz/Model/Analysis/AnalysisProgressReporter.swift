 This protocol is adapted by any object or struct that wants to report real-time progress of a running analysis. One example would be the owner of a progress bar. The primary functionality is to take the initial state, terminal condition, and current condition and estimate a percentage completion. It also tells the rest of the application on the main thread when the analysis has completed.
