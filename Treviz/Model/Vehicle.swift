 A vehicle include all the masses (dry, primary propellant, etc), aerodynamic configurations, and GNC capabilities that determine the forces on the vehicle at a given point in time. A vehicle can fly along one trajectory phase at a time. Vehicles can also include CAD models, drawings, or basic shapes to help with visualization or to automatically calculate mass and inertia.
